# Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree
In this file I put all the three projects I completed during my Machine learning engineer (Nanodegree) course.

## Project 1: Predicting Boston Housing Prices

## Project 2: Finding Donors for CharityMl

## project 3: Customer Segmentation

## Software and Libraries
This project uses the following software and Python libraries:

* Python 2.7
* NumPy
* pandas
* scikit-learn
* matplotlib  
You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a <b>Jupyter Notebook</b>.

If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the Anaconda distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and more included.
